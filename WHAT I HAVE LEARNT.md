By reading the README file of the CBF-github-fundamentals repository, I have learnt the following, among others:-

What is Git and what Git can be used for
The meaning of the term **repository**, 

Creating a repository, cloning a repository,

Upstream repo and downstream repo,

Committing and pushing as the way to add changes you made on the local machine to the remote repository on GitHub. This way other people can see my latest work. 

**Branches** and purpose of branches

Copying a repository by **forking** or **cloning"

**Forking a repository** which allows to copy someone's repo and make changes to that repo without affecting the original. Click here 
to [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

**Pull requests** - when you want to tell others about the changes you want to make on the main branch of the remote repository and ask for their review/feedback before you make those changes.

**Git dashboard** which helps to easily navigate to my repositories and see useful information about them.
Finding my **recent activity* on Git Hub from the Git dashboard

Finding my **top 10 repositories** I have interracted with - from the Git dashboard

Staying updated with other people's activities through the new feed by using the  **"Filter dropdown"** in the upper right corner to filter the feed to show only the exact event types I want to see.

Finding recommended repositories by using the **"Explore repositories"** section on the right side of my dashboard,

My **profile README** which can tell people more about myself.

Using "Markdown" on Git Hub to add some styling to my issues, pull requests, and files.

How to **"follow"** other people on git hub and **starring** repositories in order to keep track of it. To learn more about how to follow people, go to
[Following People](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people).

How to find find new projects, events, and developers to interact with by using  github.com/explore

#**Areas that I am still confused about**

I am still confused about **"Issues"** and will need to practice more on these.
