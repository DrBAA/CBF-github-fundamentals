## **What I have learnt**

By reading the **README** file of the **CBF-github-fundamentals repository**, I have learnt the following, among others:-

1). What is Git and what Git can be used for

2). The meaning of the term **repository**, 

    * Creating a repository, **cloning** a repository,

    * Upstream repo and downstream repo,

    * Committing and pushing as the way to add changes you made on the local machine to the remote repository on GitHub. This way other people can see my latest work. 

3). **Branches** and purpose of branches

4). Copying a repository by **forking** or **cloning**.

5). [**Forking a repository**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) which allows to copy someone's repo and make changes to that repo without affecting the original.

6). That you can [**make pull requests**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) - when you want to tell others about the changes you want to make on the main branch of the remote repository and ask for their review/feedback before you make those changes.

7). That you can create [**issues**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) in a repository as a way to help keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project, and let others know what you plan to work on, or for telling others about a bug you found or a feature you think could be added to their repository. Issues need to be enable in a repository for you to be able to create an issue.

    * That you can **link an issue to a pull request** to show that work is in progress and when the pull request merges, the linked issue gets automatically closed. 

8). **Git dashboard** which helps to easily navigate to my repositories and see useful information about them.

    * Finding my _**recent activity**_ on Git Hub from the Git dashboard

    * Finding my **top 10 repositories** I have interracted with - from the Git dashboard

9). Staying **updated with other people's activities** through the new feed by using the  **"Filter dropdown"** in the upper right corner to filter the feed to show only the exact event types I want to see.

10). Finding recommended repositories by using the **"Explore repositories"** section on the right side of my dashboard,

11). How to **add** [**my profile README**](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme#prerequisites) which can tell people more about myself.

     * How to **remove my profile README** by changing the repo to private.

12). Using [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on Git Hub to add some styling to my issues, pull requests, and files.

13). How to ["follow people"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people) on git hub in order to receive notifications about their public GitHub activities and discover new projects.

14). [**How to star**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) repositories in order to make it easier to find a repository or topic again later. 

15). How to find new projects, events, and developers to interact with by using [github.com/explore](github.com/explore).

## **What I have been able to do after reading the README file**

I have been able to
 - fork the CBF-github-fundamentals repository into my own github account
 - add my own profile README.
 - create this markdown file, adding some styling and URL links as shown within this file.
 - add a star to the CBF-github-fundamentals repository
 - find repositores that I have starred 
 
## **Areas that I am still confused about or still need to cover**

- I am still confused about issues and pull requests. I will need to read and practice more on this area.
